![EV Charging Station Banner](https://i.imgur.com/gO2bY6M.png)

## üìñ Overview

Predictive modeling and geospatial analysis of California's EV charging infrastructure. This project explores charger distribution, predicts potential demand hotspots, and identifies underserved areas using machine learning. The goal is to follow a complete, end-to-end ML pipeline, from initial data exploration to the deployment of a simple interactive application.

This project is part of a self-paced learning journey to master practical data science skills.

## üéØ Project Objectives

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Perform a deep dive into the dataset to understand the distribution, density, and types of EV chargers across California.
* **Geospatial Visualization:** Create interactive maps to visualize charger locations, identify clusters, and pinpoint "charging deserts."
* **Predictive Modeling:** Develop a regression model to predict a "demand score" for charging stations based on their features (location, charger types, facility, etc.).
* **Clustering:** Use unsupervised learning to group stations into distinct categories, revealing patterns in the state's infrastructure.
* **Deployment:** Build a simple web application using Streamlit to interact with the trained model.
